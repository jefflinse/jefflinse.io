# jefflinse.io

Hugo sources (content, styles, etc.) for my personal website, [jefflinse.io](https://jefflinse.io).

I publish and host my site using GitHub Pages by pushing static content to [jefflinse/jeffinse.github.io](https://github.com/jefflinse/jefflinse.github.io). If you intend to do the same thing, I suggest following [this guide](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
