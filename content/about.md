I'm a software developer for WarnerMedia in Seattle, WA where I build cloud infrastructure, tools, and services to support our on-premises datacenter and, more broadly, client development for HBO MAX. I'm currently immersed in Golang, Docker, SNMP, and a handful of AWS services including Lambda, IoT, and API Gateway.

I also happen to be an avid homebrewer and amateur neuro-evolution hobbyist, as some of my [side projects](/projects) would suggest.

You can reach me by emailing `jeff` _at_ `jefflinse` _dot_ `com` or via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jefflinse).
