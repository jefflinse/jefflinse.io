A handful of projects that I pick away at or maintain in some sort of official capacity.

## critters

[Critters](https://github.com/jefflinse/critters) is a evolution simulator in which creatures evolve to adapt to their environment.

## githubsecret

[githubsecret](https://github.com/jefflinse/githubsecret) is a Go package for encrypting secrets to be used in GitHub Actions workflows.

## handyman

[Handyman](https://github.com/jefflinse/handyman) is a tool for composing and running configuration-based CLI apps. It began as a way to scratch an itch when I got tired of managing an army of aliases and shell scripts for my various projects.

## pr-semver-bump

[pr-semver-bump](https://github.com/jefflinse/pr-semver-bump) is a GitHub Action for automatically bumping and tagging a new semantic version for your repository whenever a pull request is merged. I prefer this workflow over most other actions that key off of commit messages when determining the next version part, because it allows the nature of the next release version to be discussed and agreed upon during code review.

## go-ray-tracer

[go-ray-tracer](https://github.com/jefflinse/go-ray-tracer) is my Golang implemenation as I work my way through [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/), an excellent test-driven tutorial for building a simple ray tracer from scratch.
