A handful of projects that I pick away at and/or maintain.

## Handyman

[Handyman](https://github.com/jefflinse/handyman) is a tool for composing and running configuration-based CLI apps. It began as a way to scratch an itch when I got tired of managing an army of aliases and shell scripts for my various projects.

## GitHub Action: pr-semver-bump

[pr-semver-bump](https://github.com/jefflinse/pr-semver-bump) is a GitHub Action for automatically bumping and tagging a new semantic version of your repository whenever a pull request is merged.

## Go-ray-tracer

[go-ray-tracer](https://github.com/jefflinse/go-ray-tracer) is my implemenation as I work my way through [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/), an excellent test-driven tutorial for building a simple ray tracer from scratch.
